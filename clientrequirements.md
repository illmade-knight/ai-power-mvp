**Client A: Energy & Emissions Monitoring - Consolidated Requirements**

This document consolidates the initial AI-generated requirements with the specific points noted by the consultant after a client discussion.

### Goal A: Reduce Overall Electricity Costs

**A1: Energy Monitoring & Visualization**
* **A1.1 Data Acquisition:** The system must collect electricity consumption data in near real-time (e.g., data points every 1 to 15 minutes, configurable) from designated main and sub-meters.
* **A1.2 Granular Breakdown:** The system must support monitoring and breakdown of usage by:
    * Overall facility consumption.
    * Specific locations within the facility.
    * Within locations, by usage categories (e.g., HVAC, lighting, compute, production lines, large machinery/equipment where sub-metered).
* **A1.3 Interactive Dashboard:** An intuitive, web-based dashboard (and/or mobile application interface) must display:
    * Real-time power demand (kW).
    * Cumulative energy consumption (kWh) over selectable periods (e.g., last hour, today, this week, this month).
    * Historical consumption trends and patterns over various time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, annually).
    * Comparison against user-defined baselines or targets.
* **A1.4 Iterative Dashboard Development:** The dashboard should be developed iteratively. Insights and useful visualizations identified through advanced analysis tools (like Tableau or Looker Studio) should inform the creation of new, generally available features and views within the system's dashboard.
* **A1.5 Data Logging:** All collected consumption data must be logged securely and reliably with timestamps.

**A2: Peak Demand Management & Cost Optimization**
* **A2.1 Peak Identification:** The system must identify and log historical peak demand periods based on utility tariff structures to facilitate trend analysis.
* **A2.2 Peak Alerts:** The system must provide configurable alerts (e.g., email, SMS, dashboard notification) when current demand approaches a predefined percentage of the typical or contractual peak demand threshold.
* **A2.3 Tariff Management:** The system must allow administrators to input and manage complex electricity tariff structures, including:
    * Time-of-Use (TOU) rates (peak, off-peak, shoulder periods).
    * Demand charges (based on peak kW).
    * Fixed charges and other applicable fees.
* **A2.4 Cost Calculation:** The system must calculate and display estimated electricity costs in near real-time and historically, based on consumption and the configured tariff structure.
* **A2.5 Load Shifting Insights (Potential for Phase 2):** The system should provide insights or reports highlighting opportunities for shifting loads from peak to off-peak periods to reduce demand charges.

**A3: Anomaly Detection & Waste Identification**
* **A3.1 Anomaly Detection:** The system must employ algorithms (e.g., statistical methods, machine learning) to detect abnormal energy consumption patterns, such as:
    * Unexpectedly high consumption during off-hours.
    * Equipment consuming more energy than its baseline.
    * Sudden spikes or drops in consumption inconsistent with known operations.
* **A3.2 Anomaly Alerts & Reporting:** The system must generate alerts for identified anomalies, providing details about the location, time, and nature of the anomaly. These alerts can be part of the targeted reporting system (see A4.6).

**A4: Reporting, Analytics & Data Accessibility**
* **A4.1 Consumption Trend Reports:** The system must generate customizable reports detailing energy consumption (kWh) and demand (kW) over various periods (daily, weekly, monthly, custom range) for the entire facility and for specific monitored locations and categories, clearly identifying trends.
* **A4.2 Cost Reports:** The system must generate reports detailing electricity costs, broken down by tariff components (energy charges, demand charges, etc.), allowing for trend analysis of cost drivers.
* **A4.3 Comparison Reports:** Reports should facilitate comparison of energy usage and costs across different periods, locations, categories, or against set targets.
* **A4.4 Data Export for Simple Tools:** Users must be able to export report data and raw consumption data in common formats suitable for simple tools like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel (e.g., CSV, XLSX) for presentations and ad-hoc analysis.
* **A4.5 BI Tool Integration & Data Availability:** Data must be accessible to Business Intelligence tools like Tableau or Google Looker Studio. This may be achieved through:
    * Robust API access to raw and aggregated data.
    * Direct database connections (with appropriate security considerations).
    * Specific export formats optimized for these tools.
* **A4.6 Targeted & Conditional Reporting:** The system must distribute reports and synopses of usage to different user groups.
    * Report content and frequency should be customizable per user group.
    * Some groups may require detailed routine analysis, while others may only require reports under specific conditions (e.g., fault detection, overuse alerts, anomaly detection).

### Goal B: Monitor Carbon Emissions for Legal Requirements

**B1: Carbon Emission Calculation & Tracking**
* **B1.1 Emissions from Electricity:** The system must calculate CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions resulting from electricity consumption.
* **B1.2 Configurable Emission Factors:**
    * The system must allow administrators to input and manage location-specific or provider-specific grid emission factors (e.g., kg CO2e/kWh).
    * The system should support time-varying emission factors if applicable (e.g., seasonal or hourly factors if provided by the utility/region).
* **B1.3 Emissions Tracking & Trend Analysis:** The system must track calculated CO2e emissions over time (daily, weekly, monthly, annually) and support analysis of emission trends.
* **B1.4 Scope Definition:** Initially, the system will focus on Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased electricity). The system architecture should consider potential future expansion to other scopes if required by the client.

**B2: Compliance Reporting**
* **B2.1 Regulatory Report Generation:** The system must be capable of generating reports formatted to meet specific, identified upcoming legal requirements for carbon emission reporting. (The exact format and data points will need to be specified based on the relevant legislation).
* **B2.2 Report Content:** Emission reports must include:
    * Total CO2e emissions for the reporting period.
    * Breakdown by source/location/category if monitored at that granularity.
    * The emission factors used in calculations.
    * Underlying electricity consumption data used for the calculations.
* **B2.3 Audit Trail:** The system must maintain an auditable log of all data relevant to emissions calculations, including consumption data, applied emission factors, and any manual adjustments with justifications.

**B3: Emission Reduction Insights (Proactive Measures)**
* **B3.1 Target Setting:** The system should allow users to set internal carbon emission reduction targets.
* **B3.2 Progress Tracking:** The dashboard and reports should visualize progress towards these emission reduction targets.
* **B3.3 Correlation with Cost Reduction:** The system should highlight correlations between energy cost-saving measures and carbon emission reductions.

### General System-Wide Requirements (Non-Functional)

* **GS1: Hardware Integration:** The system must reliably interface with specified IoT energy monitoring hardware (e.g., smart meters, current transformers, data loggers) using standard protocols (e.g., Modbus, MQTT, BACnet, or vendor-specific APIs).
* **GS2: Data Integrity & Accuracy:** The system must ensure high levels of data accuracy from sensor to report. This includes data validation and error checking mechanisms.
* **GS3: Scalability:** The system architecture must be scalable to accommodate:
    * An increase in the number of monitored points/devices/categories.
    * Increased data volume.
    * Potential future expansion to multiple sites.
* **GS4: Security:**
    * **GS4.1 Data Security:** All sensitive data (consumption, costs, emissions) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    * **GS4.2 Access Control:** The system must implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only have access to data and functionalities relevant to their roles (relevant for A4.6 Targeted Reporting).
    * **GS4.3 Secure Authentication:** Secure mechanisms for user authentication must be in place.
* **GS5: Usability & User Interface (UI):** The UI (web and/or app) must be intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to personnel with varying levels of technical expertise.
* **GS6: Reliability & Availability:** The system should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime. Define target availability (e.g., 99.9%).
* **GS7: Maintainability:** The system should be designed for ease of maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. This includes comprehensive documentation for administrators and developers.
* **GS8: Interoperability (Future Consideration):** While not an immediate requirement, the system design should consider future interoperability with other client systems (e.g., Building Management Systems, ERP systems).
