Okay, this is a great next step for your load testing setup\! Building a Pub/Sub verifier that can dynamically create and clean up subscriptions, measure latencies, and record results will give you valuable insights.

Here's a plan and the initial Go script for this pubsub\_verifier.go.

**Strategy and Design Points:**

1. **Purpose:** The verifier will subscribe to the output topics of your ingestionservice (enriched and unidentified messages) during a load test.
2. **Dynamic Subscriptions:**
    * It will create new, unique subscriptions for each topic at the start of its run. This ensures it only receives messages pertinent to the current test run and doesn't interfere with other consumers or old messages.
    * These subscriptions will be deleted automatically at the end of the verifier's run (even if interrupted).
3. **Latency Measurement:**
    * The verifier will expect messages on the Pub/Sub topics to contain the original MessageTimestamp (client-side publish time from the load generator) and the ClientMessageID that your mqtt\_load\_generator\_v1 (in the Canvas) is designed to embed.
    * **Important:** Your ingestionservice needs to be updated to propagate these two fields (MessageTimestamp as, say, OriginalClientTimestamp, and ClientMessageID) into the EnrichedMessage and UnidentifiedDeviceMessage structs it publishes.
    * Latency will be calculated as VerifierReceiveTime \- OriginalClientTimestamp.
4. **Data Recording:**
    * Each processed message will generate a record: ClientMessageID, OriginalClientTimestamp, VerifierReceiveTime, Latency, TopicSource (e.g., "enriched" or "unidentified").
    * Metadata about the load test run itself (test ID, start time, duration, machine info, environment name, parameters from the load generator if known) will also be recorded.
    * Results will be written to a local JSON file. A JSONL format (one JSON object per line) is also a good option if you expect a very large number of message records. For now, we'll aim for a single JSON object containing the run metadata and a list of individual message records.
5. **Command-Line Parameters:**
    * GCP Project ID.
    * Short ID of the "enriched" Pub/Sub topic.
    * Short ID of the "unidentified" Pub/Sub topic.
    * Duration of the verification run.
    * Output file path for results.
    * A unique Test Run ID (e.g., UUID).
    * Optional: strings for machine info, environment name for metadata.
6. **Cleanup:** Robust cleanup of temporary subscriptions is critical, using defer and signal handling.

I'll create the pubsub\_verifier.go script now. This script will assume that your ingestionservice will eventually forward the ClientMessageID and MessageTimestamp (as OriginalClientTimestamp) in its output messages.

**Key Features of this Script:**

1. **Configuration:** Uses command-line flags for essential parameters.
2. **Dynamic Subscriptions:** Creates unique subscriptions with a verifier-\<type\>-\<uuid\> pattern and ensures they are deleted using defer.
3. **Message Processing (processMessage):**
    * Acknowledges messages.
    * Unmarshals into IngestedMessagePayload (you'll need to ensure your ingestionservice populates OriginalClientTimestamp and ClientMessageID in the messages it publishes).
    * Calculates two latencies:
        * LatencyMillis: End-to-end from client publish to verifier receive.
        * ProcessingLatencyMillis: From client publish to Pub/Sub publish time (approximates ingestionservice processing \+ Pub/Sub internal publish).
    * Stores records in a thread-safe slice.
4. **Concurrent Receivers:** Launches a goroutine for each subscription.
5. **Graceful Shutdown:** Handles SIGINT and SIGTERM to cancel the main context, allowing receivers to stop and subscriptions to be cleaned up.
6. **Results Output:**
    * Collects all individual message records and metadata about the test run.
    * Marshals this into a JSON structure and writes it to the specified output file.
7. **Emulator Support:** Includes an \-emulator-host flag for testing against a local Pub/Sub emulator.

**Before Running This Verifier:**

1. **Update ingestionservice:**
    * Modify your connectors.EnrichedMessage and connectors.UnidentifiedDeviceMessage structs (in ingestion/connectors/message\_types.go) to include fields for OriginalClientTimestamp time.Time and ClientMessageID string.
    * When your ingestionservice processes an MQTTMessage (from the load generator), it must copy the MQTTMessage.MessageTimestamp into OriginalClientTimestamp and MQTTMessage.ClientMessageID into the ClientMessageID field of the outgoing EnrichedMessage or UnidentifiedDeviceMessage.
2. **Build:** go build pubsub\_verifier.go
3. **Run Example:**  
   Bash  
   ./pubsub\_verifier \\  
   \-project "your-gcp-project-id" \\  
   \-enriched-topic "enriched-device-messages" \\  
   \-unidentified-topic "unidentified-device-messages" \\  
   \-duration 2m \\  
   \-output "load\_test\_results\_run001.json" \\  
   \-run-id "run001-$(date \+%s)" \\  
   \-machine-info "$(uname \-a)" \\  
   \-env-name "gcp-test-env" \\  
   \-log-level "info"  
   \# \-emulator-host "localhost:8085" \# If using an emulator

**Next Steps for the Verifier:**

1. **Implement Aggregate Latency Statistics:**
    * After collecting all MessageVerificationRecords, calculate P50, P90, P99, average, min, and max latencies. Add these to the TestRunResults struct. You can use libraries or simple sorting and slicing for this.
2. **Error Counting:** Add counters for messages that failed to unmarshal or had missing timestamps.
3. **More Sophisticated Output:**
    * Consider CSV output for easier import into spreadsheets.
    * For JSONL, you'd write each MessageVerificationRecord as a separate JSON line immediately after processing, which is better for very long runs to avoid keeping everything in memory.
4. **Refine IngestedMessagePayload:** Ensure it accurately reflects the fields your ingestionservice actually publishes to Pub/Sub, especially OriginalClientTimestamp and ClientMessageID.

This script provides a strong foundation for your Pub/Sub verification needs during load testing.
