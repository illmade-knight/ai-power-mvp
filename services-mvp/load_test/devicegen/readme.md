Okay, let's get started on that MQTT load generator. This is a great first step as outlined in the Canvas "Load Testing Strategy: Ingestion Service".

I'll create a basic Go script that uses paho.mqtt.golang. It will be a command-line tool that takes parameters for the number of devices, message rate, duration, broker URL, and topic structure. Each message will embed a client-side timestamp and a unique message ID.

The payload generation will mimic the structure your xdevice package decodes. This means the RawPayload field within the MQTTMessage (which your ingestionservice consumes) will be a hex-encoded string. This hex string, when decoded by xdevice.DecodePayload, should yield the fields like UID, Reading, etc.

Here's the initial script for the MQTT load generator. This will be a new file, let's call it mqtt\_load\_generator.go.

mqtt\_load\_generator.go \- Basic MQTT Load Generator  
Jun 2, 5:14 PM

**Explanation and How to Use:**

1. **Save the Code:** Save the code above as mqtt\_load\_generator.go.
2. **Build:** go build mqtt\_load\_generator.go
3. **Run:**  
   Bash  
   ./mqtt\_load\_generator \\  
   \-broker "tcp://your-mqtt-broker-host:1883" \\  
   \-topic "devices/{DEVICE\_EUI}/data" \\  
   \-devices 100 \\  
   \-rate 5 \\  
   \-duration 2m \\  
   \-qos 1 \\  
   \-clientid-prefix "myloadtest"

    * \-broker: URL of your MQTT broker.
    * \-topic: The pattern for the MQTT topic. {DEVICE\_EUI} will be replaced with a generated EUI for each simulated device.
    * \-devices: Number of concurrent virtual devices.
    * \-rate: Messages per second *per device*.
    * \-duration: Total time the load test will run (e.g., "30s", "5m", "1h").
    * \-qos: MQTT Quality of Service level (0, 1, or 2).
    * \-clientid-prefix: A prefix for MQTT client IDs to help identify them.

**Payload Generation (generateXDeviceRawPayloadBytes):**

* It creates an XDeviceDecodedPayload struct with some randomized float values.
* The UID field is a 4-character string, cycling through "DEV0" to "DEV9" and then padding. You might want to make this more unique or configurable if needed.
* It then serializes this struct into a 24-byte slice, matching the byte order (BigEndian for floats) and field order from your xdevice.DecodePayload function.
* This byte slice is then hex-encoded to become the RawPayload in the MQTTMessage.

**Message Structure (MQTTMessage):**

* This struct is what gets marshalled to JSON and published.
* DeviceInfo.DeviceEUI: A unique EUI is generated for each simulated device (e.g., "LOADTEST-000001").
* RawPayload: Contains the hex-encoded string from generateXDeviceRawPayloadBytes.
* MessageTimestamp: Set to time.Now().UTC() just before publishing. This is your client\_publish\_timestamp.
* ClientMessageID: A UUID to uniquely identify each message sent by the load generator.

**Next Steps & Recommendations:**

1. **Test with a Local Broker:** Before hitting your actual ingestionservice, test this generator against a local Mosquitto (or other) MQTT broker to ensure it's connecting and publishing as expected. Use an MQTT client tool (like MQTT Explorer or mosquitto\_sub) to subscribe and inspect the messages.
2. **Refine Payload Generation:**
    * The current generateXDeviceRawPayloadBytes uses random data. You might want to make this more configurable or use predefined sets of data if your tests require specific payload values.
    * The 4-byte UID generation is very basic. If your xdevice expects more varied UIDs, adjust this.
3. **Error Handling & Reporting:** The current script logs errors to stdout. For more serious load testing, you might want to:
    * Count errors per device/globally.
    * Write summary statistics (total messages sent, error counts) at the end.
4. **Resource Limits:** When simulating a very large number of devices (many MQTT clients), be mindful of file descriptor limits (ulimit \-n) on the machine running the generator.
5. **Distribution (Advanced):** For extremely high loads that a single machine cannot generate, you'd look into distributed load testing frameworks (e.g., k6 with its distributed execution mode, or custom solutions using Kubernetes).
6. **Integrate with Verifier:** Once this is working, the next step (as per the Canvas) is to build the "Pub/Sub Verifier" application that subscribes to the output topics of your ingestionservice to measure end-to-end latency using the MessageTimestamp and ClientMessageID.

This script provides a good foundation for your MQTT load generation needs.
