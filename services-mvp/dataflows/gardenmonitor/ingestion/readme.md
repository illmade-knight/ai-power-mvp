## end to end

Our cloud end to end testing found an issue with handling mqtt.
We were dropping messages when we had a large number of messages per second

Now some of this was probably down to using firestore instead of redis in our initial testing
(firestore was easy to emulate, see changes etc) but there are some mqtt issues we probably want 
to address and maybe we should just decouple mqtt handling from any processing at all

later we may want to look at the mqttClient to ensure we don't drop any messages 
but we'll wait to see how our end to end cloud testing progresses
