You're right, that's a crucial distinction\! The RawDeviceData struct I was working with in the GCSDataArchiver was a hypothetical input, not the actual EnrichedMessage or UnidentifiedDeviceMessage that your ingestion service will be publishing to Pub/Sub.

Let's refactor this. The archival service will:

1. Consume a Pub/Sub message (which is \[\]byte).
2. Attempt to deserialize this byte array. We need a way to determine if it's an EnrichedMessage or an UnidentifiedDeviceMessage. A good way is to try unmarshalling into a combined struct or check for distinctive fields.
3. Based on the deserialized content (specifically, the presence and validity of LocationID from an EnrichedMessage, or the presence of ProcessingError from an UnidentifiedDeviceMessage), it will determine the GCS path (either using LocationID or routing to a deadletter path).
4. The data actually stored in GCS for audit should ideally be the *original Pub/Sub message payload* itself, perhaps with a few added archival metadata fields if necessary, but not necessarily re-transformed into yet another struct unless that simplifies batching. For batching, we'll store a representation of the incoming message.

I'll update the gcs\_archiver\_go Canvas.

**Key Changes:**

1. **RawDataForArchival struct**: This will be the new struct that GCSDataArchiver uses internally for batching. It will store the essential parts of the incoming message and a flag to indicate its type.
2. **GCSDataArchiver.Archive method signature change**: It will now accept the raw pubSubMessagePayload \[\]byte and the messageTimestamp time.Time (which should be the timestamp used for creating the date-based GCS path, likely the MessageTimestamp from within the payload or the Pub/Sub message's publish time).
3. **Deserialization Logic in Archive**: It will try to unmarshal the payload into a temporary struct that can hold fields from both EnrichedMessage and UnidentifiedDeviceMessage to determine the path and what to store.
4. **Path Determination**: Uses LocationID if present and valid in an enriched message; otherwise, uses "deadletter".
