Okay, that naming convention makes sense for your retrieval pattern:

gs://\<your-bucket\>/raw-audit-logs/daily-aggregates/\<year\>/\<month\>/\<day\>/\<locationID\>/\<batchID\_or\_timestamp\>.json.gz

This structure indeed allows you to easily list all data for a date range and then, if needed, filter or process by locationID.

Let's design the GCSDataArchiver with simple batching. For this initial version, the batching will be primarily size-based (number of messages per batch) and also flushed on Stop(). Time-based flushing can be added later if needed.

I'll create the Go code for the archiver and its unit tests, including GCS client mocking.

First, here's the implementation for GCSDataArchiver:

**Key Considerations and Assumptions in this Code:**

1. **RawDeviceData and LocationID:**
    * The user's desired GCS path is .../\<year\>/\<month\>/\<day\>/\<locationID\>/....
    * This means LocationID **must** be available when Archive() is called.
    * The RawDeviceData struct defined in the raw\_data\_storage\_options artifact **does not currently include LocationID**.
    * **Crucial Point:** For the GCSDataArchiver to correctly form the path, the RawDeviceData struct it receives needs to contain LocationID, or Archive() needs another way to get it (e.g., as a separate parameter, from context).
    * In the GCSDataArchiver code above, I've highlighted where LocationID is needed for the batchKey. I've used data.DeviceEUI as a **placeholder** for the location part of the batch key. **This needs to be changed in gcs\_archiver\_go to use the actual LocationID once it's made available in RawDeviceData or passed to the Archive method.**
    * The unit tests use a TestRawDeviceData struct that *includes* LocationID and then try to map it. This again highlights the dependency. For the tests to be truly meaningful for the path, the GCSDataArchiver must use this LocationID.
2. **GCS Client Mocking:**
    * I've defined interfaces (GCSClient, GCSBucketHandle, GCSObjectHandle, GCSWriter) that abstract the necessary parts of the cloud.google.com/go/storage client. This is a common pattern for better testability.
    * The GCSDataArchiver's NewGCSDataArchiver now takes the concrete \*storage.Client and internally uses an adapter (gcsClientAdapter) to satisfy its GCSClient interface field. This keeps the public API of NewGCSDataArchiver clean while allowing the internal implementation to use the interface for easier mocking in tests.
    * The mock implementations (mockGCSClient, etc.) allow you to control the behavior of GCS operations during tests (e.g., simulate errors, capture written data).
3. **Batching in GCSDataArchiver:**
    * Archive() adds data to an in-memory batchMap, keyed by year/month/day/locationID.
    * flushBatch() is called when a batch reaches BatchSizeThreshold or when Stop() is called.
    * flushBatch() runs in a goroutine to avoid blocking the Archive() call. sync.WaitGroup is used to ensure these goroutines complete during Stop().
    * Data is marshaled to a JSON array and then gzipped before upload.
4. **Error Handling:** Errors during GCS upload in flushBatch are logged. The Archive method itself doesn't return these async errors. A more robust system might send these to an error channel or implement retries.

**Next Steps for You:**

1. **Resolve LocationID in RawDeviceData:** This is the most critical step. Decide how LocationID will be made available to the GCSDataArchiver's Archive method and update the RawDeviceData struct in raw\_data\_storage\_options and the GCSDataArchiver's batchKey logic accordingly. The tests are written assuming LocationID will be used for the path.
2. **Integrate GCS Client Library:** go get cloud.google.com/go/storage and github.com/google/uuid.
3. **Review and Run Tests:** Once LocationID is consistently handled, these tests should provide a good base for verifying your batching and GCS upload logic. You might need to adjust the mock objects or test assertions based on the final details of your GCSDataArchiver.
