You're thinking along the right lines\! Yes, using a BigQuery emulator is a good approach for integration testing your BigQueryInserter. It allows you to test the interaction with a BigQuery-like API without incurring costs or affecting a real BigQuery project.

**Emulator Suitability for Integration Tests:**

* **Yes, it's suitable:** The BigQuery emulator (like the one you can start with gcloud beta emulators bigquery start or via a Docker image like ghcr.io/goccy/bigquery-emulator often used with testcontainers-go) is designed for local development and testing. It provides an environment that mimics the BigQuery API for common operations like creating datasets/tables, inserting data, and running queries.
* **What it tests:** It allows you to verify:
    * That your BigQueryInserter can correctly connect to a BigQuery-like endpoint.
    * That it can create the table with the inferred schema from your MeterReading struct (as per your current NewBigQueryInserter logic) or interact with a pre-existing table.
    * That the Insert method correctly sends data in a format the BigQuery API accepts.
    * That you can query the data back from the emulator to verify it was stored as expected.
* **Limitations:**
    * **Feature Parity:** Emulators might not support *all* the advanced features, specific SQL functions, or performance characteristics of the live BigQuery service. For standard DML (inserts) and basic DQL (selects), they are generally quite good.
    * **IAM and Security:** Emulator environments usually have simplified or no IAM, so you won't be testing real-world permission setups.
    * **Performance:** Don't rely on emulator performance for benchmarking.

**Connecting the Go BigQuery Client to the Emulator:**

This is where it's a bit different from the Pub/Sub or Firestore emulators, which often rely heavily on the PUBSUB\_EMULATOR\_HOST or FIRESTORE\_EMULATOR\_HOST environment variables for the client libraries to auto-detect them.

For the official Go BigQuery client library (cloud.google.com/go/bigquery):

1. **Project Configuration:** The emulator runs under a specific project ID. You need to ensure your Go client is also targeting this same project ID when it makes API calls.
    * When using testcontainers-go with an image like ghcr.io/goccy/bigquery-emulator, the container might be configured to use a specific project ID (e.g., often the one you pass when starting it or a default like "test").
    * Your BigQueryInserterConfig should be loaded with this same project ID.
2. **Authentication:** Emulators typically don't require real authentication. You might need to use option.WithoutAuthentication() when creating the bigquery.NewClient if it tries to use default credentials that aren't valid for the emulator context.
3. **Endpoint (Less Common for BQ Client):** Unlike Pub/Sub, the standard BigQuery Go client doesn't have as straightforward an option.WithEndpoint() for a local HTTP emulator. It often relies on the gcloud environment being configured to route API calls to the emulator.
    * If you start the emulator with gcloud beta emulators bigquery start \--project=your-test-project, it usually tells you to set an environment variable like CLOUDSDK\_CORE\_PROJECT=your-test-project and CLOUDSDK\_API\_ENDPOINT\_OVERRIDES\_BIGQUERY=http://localhost:9050/ (the port can vary). The Go client library, when using Application Default Credentials, might pick these up.
    * The ghcr.io/goccy/bigquery-emulator often exposes an HTTP port (e.g., 9050), and you might need to find a way to direct the client there, potentially through environment variables it respects or by setting the BIGQUERY\_API\_ENDPOINT environment variable.

**General Plan for Integration Test:**

1. **Setup (using testcontainers-go):**
    * Start your Mosquitto container (as before).
    * Start a BigQuery emulator container.
    * Programmatically create the necessary test dataset and the target table (e.g., meter\_readings) within the BigQuery emulator using a bigquery.Client configured to talk to the emulator. You can define the schema explicitly or let it be inferred from your MeterReading struct if you create the table that way.
2. **Configure Service:**
    * Set environment variables for your xdevice service to connect to the test Mosquitto and the BigQuery emulator (correct project ID, dataset, table).
    * Instantiate your BigQueryInserter.
    * Instantiate your ProcessingService with the real BigQueryInserter.
3. **Test Execution:**
    * Start your ProcessingService.
    * Publish a test message (an EnrichedMessage JSON payload) to Mosquitto.
    * Wait for the ProcessingService to consume, decode, and attempt to insert the data into the BigQuery emulator.
4. **Verification:**
    * Use a bigquery.Client (configured for the emulator) to query the table in the emulator.
    * Assert that the row(s) exist and contain the expected data.
5. **Teardown:**
    * Stop the ProcessingService.
    * Stop/terminate the Docker containers.

This approach will give you a good end-to-end test of your xdevice service's core data path.
