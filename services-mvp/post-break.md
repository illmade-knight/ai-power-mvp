Services-MVP: Project Status Review (June 2, 2025)
This document summarizes the current state of development for the "services-mvp" project, focusing on the servicemanager and the primary ingestionservice.

1. Service Manager (servicemanager)
   This service acts as the central configuration and provisioning tool for your microservice ecosystem's Google Cloud resources.

Core Functionality:

Infrastructure Provisioning:

Manages Google Cloud resources based on a central YAML configuration file (service.yaml).

Currently supports:

Pub/Sub: Creating and deleting topics and subscriptions (pubsub.go).

BigQuery: Creating and deleting datasets and tables (bigquery.go).

Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Creating and deleting buckets, including setting location, storage class, versioning, labels, and lifecycle rules (gcs.go).

Handles environment-specific configurations (e.g., different project IDs for "test" vs. "production") and teardown protection for production environments.

Uses client abstractions and mocks for unit testing these provisioning components.

Configuration Access API (apiserver):

A new RESTful API server component that allows other microservices to query their expected resource configurations at startup.

Purpose: Enables services to self-validate their configurations against the central truth defined in the servicemanager's YAML. This helps detect misconfigurations early.

Endpoint: Serves data via an HTTP endpoint (e.g., /config?serviceName=...&env=...).

Response: Provides details on the GCP project ID, Pub/Sub topics the querying service should publish to, subscriptions it should consume from, and GCS/BigQuery resources it's declared to access. This leverages the producer_service, consumer_service, and accessing_services fields in your YAML.

Deployment: Designed to run as an HTTP server within your secure GCP project.

Directory Structure (servicemanager):

servicemanager/

main.go: Entry point to start the apiserver.

initialization/: Contains the logic for resource provisioning.

config.go: Loads and validates the main YAML configuration (TopLevelConfig), includes GetTargetProjectID.

types.go: Defines the Go structs mapping to the YAML configuration (e.g., TopLevelConfig, PubSubTopic, GCSBucket).

pubsub.go: PubSubManager for Pub/Sub resources.

bigquery.go: BigQueryManager for BigQuery resources.

gcs.go: StorageManager for GCS buckets.

*_test.go and *_integration_test.go files for these components.

apiserver/: Contains the configuration access API.

api_types.go: Defines Go structs for the JSON responses of the API (e.g., ServiceConfigurationResponse).

configserver.go: Implements the ConfigServer and its HTTP handler.

configserver_test.go: Unit tests for the ConfigServer using net/http/httptest.

Next Steps for servicemanager (Potential):

Implement the CLI commands (apply, destroy, validate, serve) more fully using a library like Cobra if not already done.

Enhance validation in LoadAndValidateConfig and in the apiserver.

Develop IAM auditing/management capabilities based on the accessing_services declarations (Phase 2).

2. Ingestion Service (ingestionservice)
   This is your primary IoT ingestion microservice. It consumes raw data (e.g., from MQTT), enriches it, and publishes it to appropriate Pub/Sub topics.

Core Functionality:

Message Ingestion & Processing:

Consumes messages from an MQTT broker.

Fetches device metadata from Firestore to enrich incoming messages.

Routes messages to either an "enriched" Pub/Sub topic or an "unidentified" Pub/Sub topic based on metadata lookup success.

Service Wrapper (server.go):

Provides a runnable application wrapper around the core ingestion logic.

Starts an HTTP server with a /healthz endpoint for Cloud Run compatibility.

At startup, calls the servicemanager's /config API to fetch its expected resource configuration (e.g., the full names of Pub/Sub topics it should publish to).

Performs basic validation by comparing its local configuration (e.g., short topic IDs) against the information received from the servicemanager.

Handles graceful startup and shutdown, including managing the lifecycle of the core ingestion components.

Shared Setup Logic (ingestion/connectors/setup.go):

A new centralized function (InitializeAndGetCoreService) is responsible for loading all configurations (MQTT, Pub/Sub publishers, Firestore fetcher) from environment variables and instantiating the core connectors.IngestionService and its dependencies.

This shared setup is used by both the ingestionservice/main.go (for the actual service) and the integration tests for the connectors package.

Directory Structure (ingestionservice and its sub-packages):

ingestionservice/

server.go: Defines the Server struct, its HTTP handlers, and the logic for interacting with the servicemanager API. Defines the CoreService interface.

config.go (to be created/fleshed out): Loads configuration for the Server wrapper (HTTP port, servicemanager API URL, expected short topic IDs).

main.go (to be created/fleshed out): Initializes dependencies using connectors.InitializeAndGetCoreService, creates the ingestionservice.Server, and runs it.

server_test.go: Unit tests for server.go using httptest and a mocked CoreService.

server_integration_test.go (planned/partially discussed): Full integration test for the Server wrapper, including interaction with a mocked servicemanager API and real (emulated) downstream services.

ingestionservice/ingestion/connectors/ (formerly just ingestion/)

Contains the core business logic and client implementations.

mqttclient.go, googlepublisher.go, googledevicecache.go, enrich.go, message_types.go, publisher.go, devicecache.go, etc.

setup.go: Contains InitializeAndGetCoreService.

connectors_integration_test.go: The integration test for the core IngestionService logic, using the shared setup and emulators (as per connectors_integration_test_go_v1 artifact).

Next Steps for ingestionservice (Potential):

Complete ingestionservice/main.go to use connectors.InitializeAndGetCoreService and run the ingestionservice.Server.

Flesh out the ingestionservice/config.go to load its specific configuration.

Implement more robust health checks in the /healthz endpoint by querying the status of the core service components (MQTT connection, Pub/Sub health).

Decide on stricter error handling if servicemanager validation fails at startup.

3. Other Ingestion Services
   You mentioned "3 IoT ingestion services." We've primarily focused on one. The patterns established for the ingestionservice (core logic in a sub-package like connectors, a Server wrapper for deployment, shared setup, servicemanager integration) can be replicated for your other ingestion services. Each would have its own specific configurations and potentially different types of connectors, but the overall architecture for deployment and configuration validation could be similar.

4. Monitoring (Beyond Configuration Access)
   The servicemanager's configuration access API lays a foundation. True operational monitoring would involve:

Services emitting metrics (e.g., message counts, processing times, error rates) to Google Cloud Monitoring (Stackdriver).

Setting up dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize these metrics.

Defining alerting policies in Cloud Monitoring based on thresholds (e.g., if message volume on a topic drops below X or error rate exceeds Y).

Structured logging from all services to Cloud Logging for easier debugging and analysis.

This review should give you a good overview of where things stand. The recent refactoring to centralize setup logic and introduce the servicemanager API are significant steps towards a more robust and manageable system.
