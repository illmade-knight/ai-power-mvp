This is an excellent and very sound approach for your MVP ingestion service, especially given your team's familiarity with microservices. Your thinking is clear, and the proposed design has several strengths:

**Positive Aspects of Your Approach:**

1.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
    * **Ingestion Service:** Its sole responsibility is to get the raw data, identify it, enrich it with essential operational metadata, and pass it on. This is a perfect example of the Single Responsibility Principle.
    * **Decoder Service (Next Step):** Keeping the decoding logic separate means you can update or even replace decoding strategies for different devices or payload versions without touching the ingestion part.

2.  **Scalability and Flexibility (Microservices):**
    * You're right, starting with microservices (if you're comfortable) avoids a potentially more complex migration later.
    * Your example of adding LoRa-specific analytics services (signal strength, uptime) without impacting the core data pipeline (decoder, storage) perfectly illustrates the power of this approach. Each service can evolve independently.

3.  **Data Provenance and Auditability:**
    * Capturing the **raw payload** alongside your metadata is crucial. This allows for:
        * **Auditing:** You always have the original data as received.
        * **Re-processing:** If your decoding logic changes or you discover an issue, you can re-process historical raw data.
        * **Debugging:** Easier to trace issues back to the source.

4.  **Metadata Enrichment at the Right Stage:**
    * Attaching client, location, and category metadata early in the pipeline is smart. This contextual information is often essential for routing, storage decisions, and subsequent analysis.

5.  **Decoupling with Message Queues/Topics:**
    * Using a topic (presumably on an MQTT broker or another message bus like Kafka/Pulsar/NATS) to send the enriched raw data to the decoder service is excellent. It decouples the ingestion service from the decoder, allowing them to scale independently and be resilient to temporary downtimes of one another.

**Things to Briefly Consider (Likely Already in Your Thoughts):**

* **Source of Metadata:** How will the ingestion service get the client, location, and category for a given device?
    * Typically, this involves a lookup based on the device ID (which you'd get from the MQTT topic or a field in the LoRaWAN payload header from the data broker).
    * This lookup might query a small database or a configuration service that stores device-to-metadata mappings. For an MVP, this could even be a configuration file, but a database/service is more scalable.
* **Security of MQTT Ingestion:** You mentioned "securely." This would involve aspects like:
    * TLS for the MQTT connection to the data broker.
    * Authentication credentials for your service to connect to the broker.
* **Format of the Message to the Decoder Topic:** While you're sending the "raw payload," the message on the new topic will likely be a structured message (e.g., a Protobuf message as you discussed earlier) containing:
    * The raw payload bytes.
    * The metadata fields (client ID, location ID/name, category).
* **Device Identification:** Ensure the mechanism for identifying the source device from the MQTT stream (e.g., from the topic structure like `lora_broker/tenant_x/device_y/data` or from a device EUI/ID within the broker's MQTT payload) is robust.

**Sanity Check Verdict:**

Your approach is **very sane and well-architected** for an MVP, especially with your team's microservice expertise. It's a clean, decoupled design that prioritizes the right things for a data ingestion pipeline:
* Getting the data reliably.
* Knowing what the data is and where it came from.
* Passing it on for specialized processing without being a bottleneck.

This design sets a strong foundation for building out the rest of your data pipeline (decoder, storage, analysis services) and for iterating by adding new features or supporting new device types in the future.

You're definitely on the right track. Let's move on to implementing this service when you're ready!
