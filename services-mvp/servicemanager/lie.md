### another hallucination

now it actually referenced the api doc I said demonstrated it had made an error to tell me it was right...

me: no you're wrong here it is (from the doc you referenced): func (*BucketHandle) IAM ¶

func (b *BucketHandle) IAM() *iam.Handle


### Show thinking
You are absolutely correct! My apologies for that oversight.

You're right, the BucketHandle.IAM() method from cloud.google.com/go/storage returns *iam.Handle (where iam typically refers to the cloud.google.com/go/iam package), not *storage.IAMHandle. Thanks for catching that and providing the clarifying snippet!

I'll update the gcs.go code in the Canvas to reflect the correct type. This will involve changing the interface and the adapter.

I've updated the GCSBucketHandle interface in the Canvas and its adapter implementation to use *iam.Handle and added the cloud.google.com/go/iam import. The rest of the file remains the same as the IAM handling was only part of the interface definition for potential future use and not active in the Setup or Teardown logic.
