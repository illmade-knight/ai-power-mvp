That's a fantastic strategic decision\! Using Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for defining shared data structures like MeterReading is an excellent choice for a microservices architecture, even in an MVP. It brings type safety, language neutrality, efficient serialization, and well-defined schema evolution.

You're right, it might seem like a bit more setup initially, but the long-term benefits in consistency, maintainability, and interoperability between services (especially if they might be written in different languages in the future) are significant.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Define the .proto file for MeterReading.**
2. **Discuss how the generated Go struct would be used,** particularly concerning BigQuery schema inference and the bigquery struct tags.
3. **Adjust the BigQueryManager's loadTableSchema function** to correctly infer the schema from this Protobuf-generated Go struct.

Let's start by defining the meter\_reading.proto file. I'll place this in a new Canvas artifact.

Protobuf Definition for MeterReading  
May 21, 12:54 PM

**Explanation of the .proto file:**

* **syntax \= "proto3";**: Specifies Protobuf version 3\.
* **package servicemanager.protos.telemetry;**: Defines a Protobuf package to prevent naming conflicts. Adjust as needed.
* **import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";**: Imports the standard Timestamp message type for handling time.
* **option go\_package \= "...";**: Crucial for Go code generation. It tells protoc where the generated Go files should conceptually belong in your Go module structure and what Go package name to use. You'll need to replace "github.com/your-org/your-repo/gen/go/servicemanager/protos/telemetry;telemetry" with your actual Go module path and desired output structure. The part after the semicolon (telemetry) is the Go package name.
* **message MeterReading { ... }**: Defines the fields.
    * I've used standard Protobuf types (string, float, google.protobuf.Timestamp).
    * Field numbers (e.g., \= 1, \= 2\) are important for binary serialization and schema evolution.
    * I've renamed XDeviceProcessedTimestamp to just processed\_timestamp for more generality, and XDeviceDecodedPayload fields are now directly part of MeterReading.
* **Note on BigQuery tags:** I've included a detailed comment explaining the implications for BigQuery schema and tags, as this is a key consideration.

**Next Steps and Impact:**

1. Code Generation: You would use protoc (the Protobuf compiler) along with protoc-gen-go to generate the meter\_reading.pb.go file from this .proto definition.  
   Example command:  
   Bash  
   protoc \--go\_out=. \--go\_opt=paths=source\_relative \\  
   \--go-grpc\_out=. \--go-grpc\_opt=paths=source\_relative \\ // If you plan to use gRPC services with these protos  
   protos/meter\_reading.proto // Assuming your .proto is in protos/

   (You might need to adjust paths and options based on your project setup.)
2. **Updating Go Code:**
    * The manually defined MeterReading struct in xdevice\_bq\_inserter.go (and any other place it's defined) would be **removed**.
    * You would **import** the generated Go package (e.g., import pb "github.com/your-org/your-repo/gen/go/servicemanager/protos/telemetry").
    * Code would now use pb.MeterReading.
    * The NewMeterReading function in xdevice\_bq\_inserter.go would now create and return \*pb.MeterReading. Its parameters might need slight adjustment if the generated struct fields differ (e.g., Timestamp fields are pointers to timestamppb.Timestamp).
3. **Updating BigQueryManager.loadTableSchema (in servicemanager\_bigquery.go):**
    * The schema\_source\_identifier in your YAML would now point to the fully qualified name of the generated Go struct (e.g., "github.com/your-org/your-repo/gen/go/servicemanager/protos/telemetry.MeterReading").
    * The loadTableSchema function, when schema\_source\_type is "go\_struct", would need to:
        * Potentially use reflection to find the type by its string name (this is advanced and can be complex/brittle).
        * **A simpler and more robust approach for the manager:** Have a registry within the manager tool where you map known schema identifier strings to actual Go types (or functions that return bigquery.Schema).  
          Go  
          // In your manager tool  
          var knownSchemas \= map\[string\]interface{}{  
          "github.com/your-org/your-repo/gen/go/servicemanager/protos/telemetry.MeterReading": (\*pb.MeterReading)(nil), // Pass a nil pointer of the type  
          }

          // In loadTableSchema  
          if typeInstance, ok := knownSchemas\[tableCfg.SchemaSourceIdentifier\]; ok {  
          return bigquery.InferSchema(typeInstance)  
          }

        * Or, if you opt for the bigquery.Saver interface approach on your generated \*pb.MeterReading, the loadTableSchema could call a static method or instantiate the object to get its schema via the Save() method's return values.
4. **BigQuery Column Names:**
    * If you use bigquery.InferSchema on the generated Go struct, the BigQuery column names will be derived from the Go field names (e.g., Uid, AverageCurrent, OriginalMqttTime).
    * If you need different names (e.g., uid, average\_current, original\_mqtt\_time), you'll need to:
        * Implement the bigquery.Saver interface on \*pb.MeterReading and define the schema (and map) there.
        * Or, use a wrapper Go struct for BigQuery insertion that has the desired bigquery:"..." tags and map data from the \*pb.MeterReading to this wrapper.

This is a significant but very positive architectural step. It will make your inter-service communication and data definitions much more robust.

Do you want to proceed with how the BigQueryManager.loadTableSchema would adapt, or discuss the bigquery.Saver approach for the generated struct?
