That's an excellent idea and a very mature approach to managing microservice dependencies and configurations\!

You're right, one of the big challenges is understanding and enforcing which services are supposed to interact with which resources. Adding this information to your central YAML configuration provides:

1. **Self-Documentation:** The YAML becomes a clearer source of truth for how services are interconnected.
2. **Early Detection of Misconfiguration:** Services can validate their own connections against this declared state at startup.
3. **Controlled Access (Conceptually):** While this YAML doesn't enforce IAM rules directly, it declares intent, which can inform IAM policies or raise flags if an undeclared service tries to connect.
4. **Impact Analysis:** If you need to change a topic or subscription, you can more easily see which services might be affected.

Here's how I'd suggest extending the YAML and the corresponding Go structs, and then how services might use this:

**1\. Proposed YAML Structure Changes:**

We can add new optional fields to your resource definitions:

YAML

\# ... (existing config) ...

resources:  
pubsub\_topics:  
\- name: "ingested-device-messages"  
labels:  
service-group: "ingestion"  
data-type: "mixed-enriched-unidentified"  
producer\_service: "ingestion-service" \# NEW: Expected producer

    \- name: "xdevice-decoded-readings"  
      labels:  
        service-group: "processing"  
        device-type: "xdevice"  
        data-type: "decoded"  
      producer\_service: "xdevice-processing-service" \# NEW

    \- name: "unidentified-device-audit-messages"  
      labels:  
        service-group: "ingestion"  
        data-type: "unidentified-raw"  
      producer\_service: "ingestion-service" \# NEW

pubsub\_subscriptions:  
\- name: "xdevice-processing-service-input-sub"  
topic: "ingested-device-messages"  
ack\_deadline\_seconds: 30  
labels:  
subscriber-service: "xdevice-processing"  
consumer\_service: "xdevice-processing-service" \# NEW: Expected consumer

    \- name: "raw-archival-service-unidentified-sub"  
      topic: "unidentified-device-audit-messages"  
      ack\_deadline\_seconds: 60  
      labels:  
        subscriber-service: "raw-data-archival"  
      consumer\_service: "icestore-archival-service" \# NEW

bigquery\_tables:  
\- name: "meter\_readings"  
dataset: "device\_telemetry"  
\# ... (other fields) ...  
accessing\_services: \# NEW: List of services expected to read/write  
\- "xdevice-processing-service" \# (writes)  
\- "reporting-service"          \# (reads \- hypothetical)

gcs\_buckets:  
\- name: "icestore-raw-device-archives-eu"  
\# ... (other fields) ...  
accessing\_services: \# NEW  
\- "icestore-archival-service" \# (writes)  
\- "audit-retrieval-tool"      \# (reads \- hypothetical)

**2\. Updating Go Structs (manager\_config\_go\_structs):**

You'd add these new fields to your Go structs. I'll show you the relevant parts that would change in the manager\_config\_go\_structs artifact.

**3\. How Microservices Would Use This:**

Each of your microservices (ingestion, archival, xdevice-processing) would:

* **Identify Itself:** Have a way to know its own canonical service name (e.g., from an environment variable SERVICE\_NAME="xdevice-processing-service" or a build-time constant).
* **Load the Central Configuration:** At startup, it would load the same manager\_config.yaml file (or access it from a shared config store if you evolve to that).
* **Verify Its Connections:**
    * **Pub/Sub Consumers:** If a service is consuming from a subscription (e.g., xdevice-processing-service consuming from xdevice-processing-service-input-sub):
        * It finds the PubSubSubscription entry for xdevice-processing-service-input-sub in the loaded config.
        * It checks if the consumer\_service field in that entry matches its own SERVICE\_NAME.
        * If not, it logs a warning ("Warning: Service 'xdevice-processing-service' is consuming from 'xdevice-processing-service-input-sub', but is not listed as the expected consumer in the central config.") or, depending on your policy, could even refuse to start or exit with an error (for stricter enforcement).
    * **Pub/Sub Producers:** If a service is producing to a topic (e.g., ingestion-service producing to ingested-device-messages):
        * It finds the PubSubTopic entry for ingested-device-messages.
        * It checks if the producer\_service field matches its own SERVICE\_NAME.
        * Logs a warning or errors out if there's a mismatch.
    * **BigQuery/GCS Access:** If a service accesses a BigQuery table or GCS bucket:
        * It finds the resource entry in the config.
        * It checks if its SERVICE\_NAME is present in the accessing\_services list.
        * Logs a warning or errors out if not listed.

**Implementation in the Manager Tool:**

Your servicemanager tool would parse this richer configuration.

* The Setup command doesn't necessarily *need* to act on these new \*\_service fields, but it *could* log them for informational purposes (e.g., "Creating topic 'X' which is expected to be produced to by service 'Y'").
* The Teardown command would similarly ignore them for its direct actions.
* You could add a new command like manager validate-connections or manager show-dependencies that parses the config and prints out the declared service-to-resource mappings.

**Benefits of This Extended Approach:**

* **Explicit Dependencies:** Makes it very clear who *should* be talking to whom.
* **Reduced "Shadow IT" or Accidental Connections:** If a new service starts using a resource without being declared, its startup check will flag it.
* **Configuration Drift Prevention:** Helps ensure that the actual running services align with the centrally declared architecture.

This is a solid step towards a more manageable and observable microservice system\! The initial implementation in your manager tool would be to update the Go structs and the YAML parsing. The logic for individual services to check this config would be part of their own startup routines.
